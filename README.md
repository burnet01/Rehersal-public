# Rehersal - NodeJS project.

This was a very easy and rushed build for a wedding rehersal (or wedding picture and video) app I was going to make usable to over 100 people at the same time, I created using basic HTML, bulit-in CSS, and other technologies (such as MongoDB).

The idea was to have them all locally upload- in a realworld example, you want the user to upload to a S3 bucket instead. 
It could also be more cost effective to make it go to a dedicated server with a lot of storage as well instead of S3.

# THIS PROJECT WAS MADE FOR A FRIEND AND SHOULD probably NEVER BE PUT INTO PRODUCTION WITHOUT TWEAKS!

# I will not be providing support!

## Running
- Have NodeJS installed
- Have a Mongo Database installed/available
- type the command npm install
- then type the command npm run app.js 

It should be this easy to run the app. However, I am not sure as technologies do change, and dependencies this project were running on are from +- 2023 and likely have vulnerabilities now or had them before as well. 

#### It should also be noted that this was NEVER put into production as I stopped this project to focus more on real life events.
